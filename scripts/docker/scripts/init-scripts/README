# init-scripts

This directory is intended to host scripts which may be mounted and executed by
the nilrt-build container in arbitrary contexts.

Unlike the sibling `init.*.d` directories, there is no implied *correct* time
for these scripts to run, and it is assumed that the user will negotiate how to
mount them into the build context.
