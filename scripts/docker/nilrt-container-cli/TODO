I am a:
	- interactive user. I want to ...
		- build a NILRT docker build container
		- start an interactive container to build some packages
		- start an interactive container to build a NILRT image
	- script (build server)
		- build the NILRT distribution
		
workflows:
	* I have no extant NILRT workspace (just the docker scripts)
		* I want to start a container which will clone the correct source ephemerally
		* I want to start a container which will clone the correct source to a bind mount
	* I have an extant NILRT workspace
		* I want to start a container which will build in the bind mounted workspace

## CLI
$0 start [--bind nilrt_path]
